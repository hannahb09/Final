Tips and Best Practices
=======================
### Start Simple and Experiment Gradually
Begin with basic prompts and adjust as you get familiar with the model's behavior. Gradually increase the complexity of your inputs.
### Use Pre-built Examples for Inspiration
Leverage the available examples in the Playground to explore different tasks and adapt them to your needs.
### Be Specific with Your Prompts
The more detailed and clear your prompt, the more accurate the model's response. Specify context or instructions to guide the model effectively
### Refine Output with Role Instructions
Assign roles to the model to improve the relevance and quality of responses for specialized tasks.
Examples
========
### Generating a Creative Story
Prompt: "Write a short story about a dragon who learns to trust humans."   
Settings:  
Model: GPT-4   
Max Tokens: 150   
Generated Output:  
Once upon a time, in a distant valley, there lived a dragon named Eldrin. For years, Eldrin had feared humans, believing they were nothing but cruel invaders. But one winter, when a group of villagers found themselves stranded in the snow, it was Eldrin who saved them. He carried them on his back through the blizzard to their village. Over time, the villagers showed him kindness, offering him food and shelter. Eldrin learned that not all humans were bad, and from that day on, he became their protector. The villagers and the dragon forged an unbreakable bond, and together, they lived in peace.
